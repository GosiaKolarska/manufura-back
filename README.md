# Project Status

This project is still in progress. I'm actively developing and refining features to enhance the user experience and functionality. Here's a brief overview of what's currently underway and what to expect in the near future:

## What's in Progress

- **Optimization of Styles**: I'm in the process of refining and optimizing the CSS styles to ensure a cohesive and visually appealing design across all components of the application.

- **Mobile Version**: The mobile version of the application is currently awaiting designs. My goal is to create a responsive and user-friendly mobile experience that aligns with the needs and expectations of our users on smaller screens.

- **Cosmetic Changes**: I'm planning some cosmetic updates to improve the overall look and feel of the application. This includes adjustments to the UI elements, color schemes, and layout tweaks to enhance usability and aesthetics.

## Coming Soon

Stay tuned for updates as I continue to develop and enhance the project. I'm excited about the improvements I have in store and look forward to sharing them with you!
